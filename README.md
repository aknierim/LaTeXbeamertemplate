# TU Dortmund LaTeX Beamer Template with Dark and Light Theme
This template is a modified version of [@maxnoe](https://github.com/maxnoe/TUDoBeamerTheme)'s LaTeX beamer theme for the TU Dortmund. It adds a dark theme option as well as some further tweaks such as a progress bar that fits within the overall aesthetics of the base theme.

## Usage
Use `make` to compile either one or both themes.
```
$ make <all | light | dark>
```
